      <p style="font-family: courier;" >hii we went outside again and our front schedule is a lil weird rn so im not gonna have time to do anything cuz i leave tm, so, yeah! but i was, indeed, here. that is all. i am also experiencing new terrors and levels of brainrot previously unknown to mankind, but you know what, we fucking ball. but seriously why have we been to the city so much this summer. WAIT. i remember i have a topic. okay maybe we mentioned it somewhere already but this clanker shit is getting on my nerves. and no its not because 'waa waa im a robot' no it is because waa waa i am a poc of african descent and i dont like how white people are getting to 'play toys' but instead of toys its making slurs for imaginary marginalized people. why. why do we do we need to do that. im watching alpharad's final mongy monday of their subathon and the stream started with clanker bs and then they all went woaahhh when one of their friends said 'is there a rigger...' (as in Live2D rigger) like are we in highschool? idk. i don't think it's funny. but maybe i am Too Woke... love the mongy though #sheep</p>

What if we make a silly ass static forum just for us to post and talk to each other on. Cuz like you'd think we would talk more with each other considering we live together in mind, but beyond simple chats we don't really get into much. I'm not discussing philosophy with Vriska ok. But like. Maybe I should be yk. So forgive me as i continue to work on that and not the other tasks!! Hehe I love doing the task that is not the task I'm supposed to be doing!!!  </p>

A way to socialize with people online that doesn't make us feel like we're tearing our brain out and stomping on our heart. Yes by the way i think the answer is yes. Im supposed to be working on the MH shrine but i'm having too much fun just... chilling on the melonland forum. Even doing a Posting once or twice. And it's making me wish forums were more popular because that way of posting makes us feel really safe! I was reading a board about site accessability, and it hit me Wow our site SUCKS so... I think this week we're gonna do a large sitewide project of making alt text for important images, and maaaybe doing alt text for art too but we draw a lot so i don't know. We used to do alt text for everything back in the day but we only stopped because we figured "no one is gonna see this, who cares" but i think people are Seeing so. So yeah. I did Not know that all-lowercase or all-uppercase typing fucks with screenreaders, so from now on i will try to use text-transform and see what happens? Im not going back and retyping everything on our website into normal caps but we'll try to do so from now on â™¡ edit: I'm so sad text transform means i cant randomly capitalize the first letter of words for emphasis ohhhhh woe is meohhhh im gonna die </p>

      <p style="font-family: courier;"> oh...it's august...thats awful. anyway. well whats good about that is that peridot is going to be forced to be nice to me and vris for a day i think that'll be funny. he HATTES vriska ok he hates her. and she vaguely dislikes him. also peri keeps calling vris and i's birthday our 'freakday' and i guess i won't stop him... in our system birthdays aren't really that serious, just a fun day for us to make stuff for each other as we don't make gifts for each other that often. some days hold more significance than others. when i was first thinking about what  day to pick i haaad to pick 8/8 right come on guys its me Number Eight in German and my typing quirk is Number 8 too, which is stolen from one spider you might know, so obviously she wouldn't just let me yoink the day. so we share it i guess! i mean we're kind of a unit so i don't mind. i cant take 8/8 from mr. Spider Guy himself so... yeah! ummm i might like write a thingy caus i was inspired by someone's essay (You Probably Know Who You Are Hii!) so watch out for that...later...er...also i overcame an anxiety thing today. our social anxiety is SO bad like its really bad i genuinely feel like our whole life is being sabotaged by it but we try okay we try! oh let me talk about typing quirks a little bit more. i think theyre sooo silly and fun idk why people hate on them so much. okay, i get if its like unreadable, and i also think websites in particular should have a toggle, but if your just talking to your friends or yapping online it shouldnt matter. sadly im not cringe and free yet so i tend not to use it (i also dont want people clocking me as a homestuck fan because we generally do not like homestuck) online but peri's been using his more so im happy for him. uhh but yeah my muscle memory is to use 8 instead of b generally and sometimes i accidentally still use 8 when im trying NOT to lol. final thing: my biggest fear (hyperbole) is seeming white like do we seem white. i feel like we seem SO white which is probably because of the stereotypes that plurality and 'kin stuff is a white person thing (okay...the community is very white though...) but we ARENNTT WE ARENT. we are mixed and our hair is a nightmare to maintain but we move. speaking of i realllyy need to brush it its getting bad...yk its bad when you can rip out the little glob knots.... okay bye </p>

      <p style="font-family: courier;"> heyyy its your neighborhood favorite "instantly depressed upon arrival" fronter acht moon splatoon, and i come with complaints. we have dreams, we've never really had "good" dreams ever maybe once or twice a year but not really bad ones. but recently after everything has happened we just. keep. dreaming. about. THEM. all of Them. i want it to stop. sometimes they do bad things but most of the time we're all friends again. vivid vivid dreams of befriending these motherfuckers. stop. make it Stop. there's a fragment of a middle schooler still left in us that yearns for playing videogames and staying up at night late talking to friends and screaming over discord calls and always having someone to talk to and i want it to shut the fuck UP. i just want it to shut up. but its okay because fat tenna guys...okay no fat tenna wont fix my problems i guess this is something to bring up to the therapist next time, and she'll use her wizard powers to brain blast our good memories that haunt us all away forever. thats how that works right. <br> <br> <br> <br> it's just hard to feel like we haven't wasted the past 7 years, being a stupidass kid surrounded by people who didn't know how to help or didn't want to help. but it's over now, it's been over ... just wish trauma didn't haunt and haunt 'n haunt... oh i just want u to know it terrifies me when i realize people actually look at this website. for some reason. who are you. hi don;t hurt me</p>

      <p style="font-family: courier;">i drived a car. terrifying. not for me but for the world. lol it was fun though but i cant imagine doing it on the road...with PEOPLE...social anxiety plus fear of cars wombo combo!? anyway. i was walking around the city w my fursuit paws on like a fuckin boss. tell me that isnt aura. as the fellow gen zs would say. pride was PACKED dude. it was okay i only got one streetpass :/ ONE...and the whole fing state was there basically...anyway, i finished up a page for vris, shes. so. intresting. the fuckin specimen. dude. soetimes it hits me: wow we really r a system. who are thess people. that aint me dude. tf. peri gets piss angry at people sexuaizing tenna and i just have to grit my teeth and power through as i think of violently pulling his wires. i mean...huh? sorry i dont like to get too weird on main (i am a MINER! i want DIAMONDS) but its ok to be a little wweird i think. begging the authority figures for a crt bc im normal. yeahhhh i think i might be techum. i mean my insys partnerthing is a robot already, i was cooked from the beginning but tenna did something to me. (deltarunes been out for a week now i think we'll stop spoiler warning stuff, soz). i finally drew something for the Tum Blr today, but also for me because it was fun, i really liked that person's silver design. oh i worked out today and cleant up too! our sewing desk has been pretty awful for like a year so i cleaned it a bit. sometimes i remember im looks to the moon rain world. im looks to the moon rain world if she was a gay mentally ill transgender teenager. i'm not like suuuuper deep into fictionkinning particularly i usually just go off vibes and chill (see: zoh shia), but peri kinassigned me so. yea. he does that a lot. im waiting for the day he kin assigns gangle /hj. but, he saw that our dynamic was similar to how we are in the game, so he saw a chance and swooped for it---and hey  iam all for presenting in headspace with a simpler form and one that doesnt make me cringe! nothing wrong with octarian me it just...feels like the real me, which i dont like, skull emoji. and then peri realized how vris slotted perfectly into the funnyman role and was like hey...heh. youre...NSH. and it WORKED??(vris only went along w it because itd make me happy i think, but hes really grown into it now, its nice). gonna go back to the city this weekend, short term goals before then: work on the paragon page, finish the html for my minidome pages, work out more lol, but i leave front tm so that'll have to wait! seeya</p>

TIRING. at times! also our social media feeds are so confused because of all our different interests its kinda funny. i dont mind seeing stuff the others like but its silly 2 me. im playing dellarunish chapter 2 (its peam), then hopefully peri can play chapter 3 soon, that chapter is FOR him. then i can play chapter four because that shit is for ME. i would like to experience it lol. goals this summer: learn to drive. maybe even get a job but thats up in the air no ones hiring and especially not hiring weird neurodivergent anxious teenager with 0 experience. oh we got invited to national honor society again we areNOT doing that bruh. we are serially good at school, sadly, we arent a goody two shoes national honors society sheep, im sure its great and fine whatever, but idk i feel like the kids that do that are simply not the kind of people we would get along with. we just hate the school system too much to do that kind of thing. just because we do well in the system doesnt mean we like the goddamn system</p>

      <p style="font-family: courier;"> yeah thats all. i had like a really thoughtful idea for a blog post earlier today and it is gone. sorry but i did go outside today (woah) and saw pigeons and lots of ducks and even a terrifying beast with its ovipositors out that was awesome. slash sarcasm. bye. oh wait i feel like me and peri should have switched which chapters we played cuz vro...3 is literally so himcore and little blud was struggling to have the same pretentious emotional hullabaloo i totally would if i played ch4. sad. so sad. (literally nothing is stopping me fromplaying chapter 4 skull) </p>

      <p style="font-family: courier;"> its almost pride month that is very cool. i had to go to our fathers house recently and im losing my goddamn marbles. one of the things i hate MOST in the world is animal abuse / neglect and our dad keeps getting animals.  why. he already has no time for that. every time i go over which isnt that often but still. istg there is a new creature. it stresses me out soo bad also he just kidna sucks, like why are you defending trump to my face. STILL. he knows were gay but nothing more than that, gamers i kind of want to come out as trans to him just to spite him. we're his "favorite daughter" i think it would give him a reality check. anyway, going there makes me really grateful for our house and our mom, we have it good. in terms of the site, eeeeveennttually we're gonna work on headspace pages, i want to make a special lil thingy majingy for myself too. at one point. not today though its late. big goal we have with the site rehaul is just to try out new things in css and html, make some cool stuff ya know, our old site was supra lame. yeah not much goin on with me other than like...being kinda sad but thats just the breaks man  </p>

      <p style="font-family: courier;"> aughh...our body has been thru so much physical work these past 3 days...we hoked up a mountain, then theres our schoolwork as well this week, our legs are COOKED!! okay um oh yeah i remembered lowk im trans and maybe one day, we should. idk. try and pass. i dont see that happening like...ever unless we end up going on t one day, but as it stands now i dont think any of us are interested in that :P also we arent friends with any trans ppl currently that kinda sucks. my transgenderists... its a little lonely, sort of, not really (3/4s the system is transmasc). earlier i asked gangle "is it okay if we masculinize the body" or smth like that and she replied "nothing you do to this thing will make me hate it more than i already do." i just thought that was funny hey can someone free her. oh happy 10th anniversary to splatoon i guess ( guy that has mixed feelings on it)  </p>

      <p style="font-family: courier;"> hey, i'm back. the reason i started my sonic tumblr was because i knew i had like.  a really weird niche. well i didnt KNOW. honestly i thought no one would care about my "crackship". but i was like...well, someone out there might like it. and a few people do. so idk i just think thasts beautiful. hey did you see the gay fanart i made of me and sig i drew that after our sister pissed us off. we share a pc and both we + our sister can be unreasonable about it, but i feel like she is way worse about it (she's younger), also once she made me sob and said i was guilt tripping her cuz i told her i had a bad day and would like to get on :skull: ah....ahhh...aahhhhh.............we just want our own room one day vro. ahuhm. anyway. i want to make a scourgespio shrine see you soon , i feel pretty good today  </p>

      <p style="font-family: courier;"> posting my art online always makes me lose some passion if that makes sense. i feel like i have to live up to expectations, even if thats fake. literally who cares. i dont think ill stop posting, i was approaching religious levels of posting a lil bit ago (posting at least twice a week) but it stressed me out bad. itll probably mess up my "staying power" but who cares, i'm an artist not a content machine. we have these ocs mal and laela, ive been trying recently to try and draw laela, shes very hard to draw (our art style went into remission due to the at phase a few years ago...and now sonic lol) i already struggle with humans somewhat nowadays but theres smth about her anatomy vro. augh. me and sig danced to hey ya in headspace, i love that one animation soososo much, tried to pull pebbles into it but he claimed there wasnt enough gpu so he couldnt dance with us. he is actually just very lame. slash affectionate i want to put him in a big black shirt that says emo in impact font. today gangle will start on her page i am very excited!! here we love gangle :) check out these bracelets i made yesterday <br> <img src="friends.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"> <br> not pictured is a sakura bracelet i made at gangle's request.  i remembered we had these orbs beads lying around, they remind me a lot of pearls so i made some of our local group! my favorite is nsh's no bias or anything. okay bye : ) i feel pretty happy even though  school is uh..stressful rn   </p>
